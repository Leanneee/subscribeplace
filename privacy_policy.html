  </center>
  <p>Welcome to our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”).  We respect the privacy of our members and users of the SubscribePlace service.  We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you as to how we collect, store, and use data resulting from your use of SubscribePlace and any of its services.  This Privacy Policy is an addition to our Terms of Service (the “Terms”), and together with the Terms controls your relationship with SubscribePlace and the Terms are expressly incorporate herein by this reference.  This Privacy Policy and any dispute concerning it are governed by the dispute resolution procedures, arbitration agreement, and class-action waiver contained within the Terms.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, though it is current as of the “Last Update” date listed at the bottom of this policy.  We will let you know anytime we make material changes to this Privacy Policy.  Any changes will be made according to the modification provisions listed below.  Having said that, you should review this policy periodically.</p>

  <p>       <strong>I.  Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) We Collect and Use</strong></p>

  <p>In using the SubscribePlace website and/or its services, you acknowledge and agree that SubscribePlace collects PII as outlined below when you create an account on SubscribePlace.  PII is provide by you and collected when you use this website, purchase a subscription, or sell a subscription.  SubscribePlace does not utilize or share any PII with third parties except as herein described.</p>

  <p>PII is information that can be used to identify or contact an individual.  Such information may include your name, telephone number, address, email address, or credit card information.  If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”) PII is “personal data” in accord with the definition in article 2 a) of the Directive 95/46 of 24 October 1995.  You are not required to provide any PII we request, but if you fail to provide us with your PII in certain circumstances and upon request, we may not be able to provide you with services via the site, or be able to facilitate your credit card purchases.</p>

  <p>The SubscribePlace website may include links to third-party websites.  Except as set forth herein, we do not share any of your PII with them.  SubscribePlace does not control, endorse, or supervise these third-party sites and such sites may collect PII when you click an external link or visit a third-party website.  This Privacy Policy does not govern your interaction with any third-party site, and you should consult with the third-party website regarding their privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

  <p>In limited circumstances, we may also ask for government identification.</p>

  <p>       <strong>II.  How We Use Your PII</strong></p>

  <p>Your PII is used internally, and allows us to facilitate transactions and to provide and deliver you access to your profile, content, and subscriptions of your choosing.  It also allows us to contact you and answer any requests or comments you may have.</p>

  <p>We also use PII internally to create, develop, and improve our fraud monitoring and loss prevention policies.  We also use your PII internally for audits and analysis to keep to site and the SubscribePlace services running as smoothly as possible.</p>

  <p>SubscribePlace may use the PII you provide in conjunction with third parties that are under contract with SubscribePlace such as our payment processors and vendors who ensure you have access to your subscriptions, content, and profile.  SubscribePlace only provides your PII to the extent necessary to ensure you are provided with these services.  SubscribePlace never provides your PII to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

  <p>Similarly, we use PII, including your date of birth, to ensure you are of suitable age to access the site and the various content available through profile owners on SubscribePlace.</p>

  <p>In limited circumstances, we may also use your PII to contact you and give you important notices, including but not limited to fraud warnings, changes in the SubscribePlace Terms, and changes to this Privacy Policy.  While you may opt out of some communications with SubscribePlace, you may not opt out of communications with SubscribePlace related to the Terms or this Privacy Policy, as these form the basis of your relationship with SubscribePlace and govern our interactions.</p>

  <p>If you are a profile owner, some of the PII you provide may be searchable to subscribers and users of SubscribePlace.  Searchable PII will be limited to user name or first and/or last name.</p>

  <p>We may create anonymous data (“Anonymous Data”) logs (logs that exclude PII) to help us conduct analysis that helps us monitor and improve SubscribePlace. We reserve all rights to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third partied at our sole discretion.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that we may access, utilize, and release your PII to comply with court orders, legal process, litigation and/or requests from governmental agencies or authorities which require us to disclose your PII.  We may also disclose your information if we determine that disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law or suspicion of violation of law.</p>

  <p>If SubscribePlace were to merge, sell, or otherwise reorganize in any way, we may transfer and deliver your PII to the relevant third party.  Such transfers are ordinarily part of any business transfers.</p>

  <p>Aside from the instances specifically addressed in this Privacy Policy, you will receive notice when your PII may go to a third party, and you will be provided with an opportunity to withhold your consent to the transfer of any such information to a third party.</p>
