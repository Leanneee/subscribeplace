  <p>These SubscribePlace Terms and Conditions of Service are a legal document that explains your rights and obligations as a user, subscriber, and member of SubscribePlace. Please read it carefully.</p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 20px;"><strong>I. Introduction</strong></p>

  <p>The following contains the general terms and conditions of contract which govern your relationship with SubscribePlace.com (“SubscribePlace”),  which is owned by Subscription Podcast Solutions, LLC. The SubscribePlace Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms”) constitutes a legal agreement between you and SubscribePlace. We reserve the right to update and/or change these Terms as needed including but not limited to changes based on our community, content database, legal issues, or market trends. Any changes that are made to these Terms will not apply retroactively, and will not apply to any dispute of which both parties had actual notice on or prior to the date of the change or amendment. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, all amended terms shall be effective immediately after they are posted. Additionally, a notice of change in Terms will be provided to you upon your access to the site after the Terms have been updated. At this time, you will be asked to read and affirmatively accept the amended Terms by clicking an “I accept” and/or an “I agree” box, or you may decline to accept the amended Terms. If you do not accept the amended Terms, you will be denied access to the site, and your relationship will be governed by the Terms as they existed at the time of your first acceptance of these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

  <p>By using or accessing this website in any way and/or selling, advertising, uploading, downloading, or submitting any content or media, or by utilization of any of the software, data feeds, or services available through the SubscribePlace website, you expressly acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy which is fully incorporated herein by this reference. These Terms apply to you and, if you are using this website on your client’s behalf, to you and all of your clients. Should you disagree with anything stated in these Terms please discontinue your use of the website and erase all data you have uploaded and/or downloaded.

  <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>SECTION XIII CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT.</strong></p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 20px;"><strong>II. Definitions</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Profile Owner.</strong> A Profile Owner is a content contributor who has registered for an account on SubscribePlace, and this contributor is selling content for a monthly subscription fee.</p>

  <p><strong>Active Subscriber.</strong> An Active Subscriber is a person with valid billing information who has purchased a monthly recurring subscription on SubscribePlace, and this person has not cancelled the subscription or been refunded their subscription price. The Active Subscriber must also not have been the subject of a credit card dispute.</p>

  <p><strong>Revenue Share.</strong> Revenue Share for a Profile Owner is the amount of money that is equal to the Active Subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month multiplied by the monthly subscription price set by the profile owner, which is not inclusive of the SubscribePlace Service Fee. This number is then subject to subtraction for any credit card disputes/chargebacks and corresponding bank charges and dispute fees. The Revenue Share amount is also referred to as a Profile Owner’s SubscribePlace Earnings.</p>

  <p><strong>$200 Minimum.</strong> If a Profile Owner generates more than $200 in a calendar month from Active Subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month, then that profile owner will have met the $200 minimum threshold. If a profile owner meets or exceeds the $200 minimum threshold, then the Hosting Fee related to the $200 minimum will be waived. However, any profile that generates less than the $200 minimum threshold from active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month shall be subject to a Hosting Fee of $200 per month. The $200 Hosting Fee will be deducted from the profile’s earnings (if any) at the end of the month. Any profile with a negative hosting fee balance may be locked and/or deleted. Once a profile has been deleted, SubscribePlace agrees to waive any negative Hosting Fee balance.</p>

  <p><strong>Hosting Fee.</strong> A fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead and costs related to the hosting of a Profile Owner account.</p>

  <p>SubscribePlace reserves the right to modify and adjust any pricing at its sole discretion, and will update the pricing schedule online (<a href="pricing.html">here</a>) a minimum of 10 days before any pricing modification. A current pricing schedule can be found (<a href="pricing.html">here</a>). SubscribePlace reserves the right to change pricing structures and impose fees on any user account type, whether it is an owner account that sells content, or a subscriber account that buys. Any change in pricing structures or fees will not apply retroactively.</p>

  <p>All charges and payments must be paid in the lawful money of the United States of America.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>b. Authorization and Automatic Renewals</strong></p>

  <p>Subscribers will be billed monthly. When a subscriber joins SubscribePlace initially, the subscriber will be billed immediately upon entering the site after the subscriber has entered valid credit card information and the subscriber hits ‘Pay and Subscribe’. The definition of ‘monthly’ will be billing at any point that is between 28 days to 31 days after the initial purchase of the subscription. The site reserves the right to set the recurring billing at any point that is 28 days to 31 days following the previous bill payment. You specifically agree, assent, and authorize SubscribePlace to charge the payment method provided by you for monthly recurring subscription charges.</p>

  <p>To continue your subscription and services without interruption, purchases will renew automatically. Until canceled, renewal purchase prices will remain the same as your initial purchase price, except for promo and discount purchases unless otherwise specified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subscription prices may, from time to time, be increased or decreased by the Content provider. In the case of an increase in subscription prices, SubscribePlace will provide you with a minimum of 10 days-notice before any pricing increase becomes effective. SubscribePlace reserves the right to approve or reject any requested subscription price increase and/or decrease.</p>

  <p>Subject to the foregoing, you may cancel any automatic renewals at any time from your account page. If your permitted cancellation request is not received in time, and your credit card is billed despite your desire to cancel your subscription, please contact SubscribePlace support by phone (800) 385-7467 or email (<a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="95fdf0f9e5d5e6e0f7e6f6e7fcf7f0e5f9f4f6f0bbf6faf8">[email&#160;protected]</a>) so that we may consider refunding your subscription fee, provided you have not used the subscription for the billed period, or accessed any Content that is the subject of your subscription in any way. Such refund determination shall be made by SubscribePlace at its sole discretion. Fees charged to your payment method may be split into multiple charges, the aggregate of which shall not exceed the amount currently due for your particular purchase.</p>

  <p>Subscription cancellations go into effect to stop the next upcoming billing cycle.  So all future billing will be stopped once a subscriber cancels.  It is the subscriber’s responsibility to go into their account and cancel their subscription if they wish to do so.</p>

  <p>A monthly billing cycle is between 28 days and 31 days in length.  If there is a billing malfunction for any reason, then SubscribePlace reserves the right to bill at a later point than 31 days, but only in a situation to make up for a previous payment that was missed due to a billing malfunction.  For example, if a subscriber joined June 5, and the subscriber is supposed to be billed again on July 5, but SubscribePlace is unable to bill until July 10 due to a billing malfunction, then SubscribePlace reserves the right to bill at this later date because the previous billing date was missed due to a billing malfunction.  In this situation, the next recurring billing date would be August 5, so the normal billing cycle would apply once the billing has been corrected.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>c. Tips to Profile Owners</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace may, but is not obligated to, permit individual money tips to profile owners through the site. To the extent that we decide to permit tips, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

  <ul style="padding: 0 0 0 60px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    <li>Payment of a tip is done at your own option and risk. Tips are not required for use of SubscribePlace.</li>
    <li>Tips are voluntary and may not be given in exchange for specific services. Promising to give a tip in exchange for any act is strictly prohibited, and such conduct will result in an immediate and lifetime ban from use of SubscribePlace.</li>
    <li>All tips are chargeable when made. We will not return a tip made from your account except in situations that are deemed by us, in our sole and absolute discretion, to be extraordinary.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Tips do not alter our code of conduct.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>d. Refund Policy</strong></p>

  <p>For individual subscription purchases, you may ask for a refund of your last purchase within 30 days from the last purchase date. Note that this is possible only if you have not accessed and/or utilized the subscription in any way. Refunds or credits will not be issued for partially used memberships, or partial month of service/membership. SubscribePlace will determine such refund requests at its sole discretion.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>e. Suspected Credit Card Fraud</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace has developed its own proprietary fraud monitoring and fraud tracking processes. If SubscribePlace becomes suspicious for any reason whatsoever of potential credit card fraud related to your subscribing credit card, SubscribePlace reserves the right in its sole discretion to lock and/or terminate your account. If SubscribePlace terminates your subscriber account based on suspicious credit card activity, SubscribePlace will refund the subscription price to your credit card. After such refund is made, the relationship between you, as a terminated subscriber, and SubscribePlace will be concluded in its entirety. At its sole discretion, SubscribePlace reserves the right to fingerprint lock suspicious credit cards from engaging in any commercial activity on the site. In order to safeguard our Profile Owners, SubscribePlace may inform the Profile Owner of the name of the subscriber involved in a credit card dispute, but SubscribePlace is not obligated to do so.</p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 20px;"><strong>VI. Profile Owner Revenue Share, Payments, and Termination</strong></p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>a. Revenue Share</strong></p>

  <p>As a user contributing Content to this site, you shall receive a Revenue Share as described and defined in these Terms and the paragraphs below. The paragraphs below (as well as the definition provided above) establish the minimum Revenue Share that is to be awarded to you as a contributing user.</p>

  <p>Provided you are otherwise in compliance with these Terms, SubscribePlace will not seek repayment from any overpayments made to you. You shall not be entitled to receive Revenue Share payment, nor shall SubscribePlace be liable for any such payment, unless and until the total amount of your unpaid Revenue Share earnings exceeds Two Hundred U.S. Dollars (US$200.00) in each calendar month (the “$200 Minimum”) defined above. You assent and agree that if you are unable to meet or exceed $200 Minimum threshold in a calendar month, the earnings for that calendar month are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>Each new calendar month is its own accounting period, and there is no carry forward of Revenue Share earnings or rollover of Revenue Share earnings. Your monthly payment (if any) shall encompass the total payment for the month, and your monthly payment is not subject to audit. Earnings do not accumulate month by month to meet the monthly $200 Minimum threshold established herein. For example only, if a profile owner earns $50 in Revenue Share in a calendar month, that $50 is below the $200 Minimum threshold, thus no payment will be made for that account and the earnings for that calendar month are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion. Moreover, this $50 cannot be used to rollover and accrue for the next calendar month to qualify for the minimum payout threshold. The $50 will not count toward the $200 Minimum Revenue Share earnings, and that money (because it fell below the $200 minimum) will not be paid out and is payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion. Using this same $50 example, if you earn $160 in Revenue Share in the calendar month that follows the $50 earnings, you still do not qualify for payment, nor will SubscribePlace be liable for any such payment. In this example, you will have earned $160, which is below the $200 Minimum threshold, and the $50 earned in the preceding month does not count toward the $200 minimum. For clarity, even though $210 was earned in aggregate over 2 months, the profile owner failed to meet the $200 Minimum threshold in a calendar month so no payment will be issued to you in either of the 2 months as explained in this example. If you earn $50 in Revenue Share in a calendar month, and then the next month you earn $210 in Revenue Share in a calendar month, then you will receive your Revenue Share payment from the $210 calendar month because that is above the $200 Minimum threshold. You will not receive a Revenue Share payment from the total $260 because the $50 in earnings in the prior month does not carry forward and does not rollover.</p>

  <p>If you have created an account and sell, or offer for sale, subscriptions to your Content you shall <strong><em>only</em></strong> receive Revenue Share payments from Active Subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month, as described in these Terms and as detailed in the SubscribePlace Fee Schedule (https://www.subscribeplace.com/pricing) which is fully incorporated by this reference. YOU WILL NOT BE PAID FOR ANY SALES THAT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVE SUBSCRIBERS AS MEASURED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE CALENDAR MONTH. ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY SUBSCRIBEPLACE FROM SALES THAT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVE SUBSCRIBERS AS MEASURED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE CALENDAR MONTH ARE PAYABLE TO SUBSCRIBEPLACE AND COLLECTED AS A HOSTING FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSCRIBEPLACE’S OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE HOSTING OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND CONTENT, AND PAYMENT PROCESSOR FEES, AMONG OTHERS.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>b. Active Subscriptions</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace will determine the final Active Subscriber number from the following time period: 5pm-est and 11:59pm-est on the final day of each calendar month. The selection point during this time frame will be at SubscribePlace’s sole discretion, and this number is not subject to audit. Active subscriber information is provided ‘as is’ in the Profile Details section of a profile account.  Any request for additional reporting will be denied.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>c. Tips to Profile Owners</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace may, but is not obligated to, permit individual money tips from subscribers to profile owners on the SubscribePlace site. A profile owner may decide to “hide” or “show” the tip button on their profile. If a profile owner decides to accept tips, then SubscribePlace will pay out the Tip money at the same time as the profile owner’s Revenue Share. SubscribePlace reserves the right to set tip limits and to also set tip parameters. For example, SubscribePlace may only allow $10, $20, or $30 tips for a profile. SubscribePlace will decide the tip parameters for each profile at its sole discretion. SubscribePlace also reserves the right to disallow a profile from receiving tips. All tips are subject to a 15% SubscribePlace Service Fee. If a tip shall be the subject of a credit dispute and/or chargeback, SubscribePlace will deduct this amount from the tip total as well as any bank charges and/or dispute fees related to the credit card dispute and/or chargeback. If a tip is refunded and/or disputed, profile owners are still responsible for any credit card fees associated with these transactions; whether it be the credit card fees associated with the original tip and/or credit card fees related to the refund and/or dispute. If a Profile Owner does not meet the $200 minimum as explained in Section VI(a), then the Profile Owner will not have qualified for a payout, and accordingly, the Profile Owner will not have qualified to receive a payout of their Tips. Tips do not count toward the $200 minimum which is based solely on active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month. Tips will only be paid out to a Profile Owner who qualifies for a payout and meets or exceeds the $200 minimum.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>d. Payment of Revenue Share and Tips</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace will remit Revenue Share payments to you through an ACH transfer only if you surpass the 200 US Dollar ($200) Minimum threshold in a calendar month from Active Subscribers, as measured on the last day of the calendar month and described in Section VI(a)-(b), and defined above.</p>

  <p>You, as the payee, authorize SubscribePlace to act as your agent for purposes of receiving payments from users/subscribers, the payors, for the sale or use of your content. SubscribePlace’s receipt of any of payment from users/subscribers pursuant to these Terms satisfies their obligations to you, the payee, for your content.</p>

  <p>SubscribePlace will pay all Revenue Shares due to you to the bank account of record associated with your profile account. SubscribePlace is not responsible for any other third-party arrangements for distribution of income. If a dispute arises between you and a third party, you agree that SubscribePlace bears no financial responsibility for the disputed funds, and the responsibility for income distribution to third parties (if any) shall be your sole responsibility.</p>

  <p>If you are a profile owner contributing Content to the site, you must enter your banking information into the Payout Information section of your account in order to receive any payment owed to you by SubscribePlace. Payment will only be made if you qualify for a payout as established by these Terms. If you qualify for a payment, you must must enter your banking information details under the section “Payout Information” of your profile. You will have up to 7 days after the 1st day of each month to enter your payment information in order to receive payment from the previous month’s Revenue Share earnings. If by the 9th day of the month or at any point after thereafter, you have not entered your banking information into the Payout Information section of your profile, then your previous month’s Revenue Share earnings are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>For <strong>international clients</strong> (outside the USA) only, SubscribePlace may elect to pay you via international bank transfer. If you are an International client, you must contact SubscribePlace at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e68e838a96a69593849585948f8483968a878583c885898b">[email&#160;protected]</a> on or before the 8th day of the month in order to qualify for the previous month’s Revenue Share earnings payout. If by the 9th day of the month or at any point thereafter, you still have not contacted SubscribePlace regarding your Payment Information, then the previous month’s Revenue Share earnings payment is payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If you qualify for a payment as established by these Terms, SubscribePlace will transfer money to the bank account on record through ACH deposit for USA domestic transfers, or other 3rd party transfer service for International Transfers. If the transfer is international, then the money transfer may be subject to financial transfer fees which will be deducted from your Revenue Share earnings; additionally, SubscribePlace reserves the right to charge up to $20 per international transfer fee as a SubscribePlace international transfer fee - this is in addition to all bank transfer fees. If SubscribePlace transfers Revenue Share earnings to the bank account on file, and the banking institution, or 3rd party transfer service keeps the payment and/or refuses to remit the money to you, SubscribePlace is not liable for these funds. Once SubscribePlace remits payment of your Revenue Share earnings via ACH transfer, or 3rd party transfer service, SubscribePlace has performed its responsibilities as required herein and is not liable for any losses losses or fees relating to your payment. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you and your banking, or third–party account are able to accept payment from SubscribePlace.</p>

  <p>If a profile owner wants to update their payout information, they must do so 5 business days before the end of the calendar month.  If the update does not happen 5 business days before the end of the calendar month, then SubscribePlace may pay the previous account on record if the update happened too late.  SubscribePlace is not liable for any payment issues related to payout information updates that are not made 5 business days before the end of the calendar month.  If SubscribePlace incurs any costs associated with correcting a payout situation (for example, issuing a new payout payroll), then the profile owner is responsible for paying that extra cost, and SubscribePlace may deduct this added cost from a Profile Owners’ earnings.</p>

  <p>If your Revenue Share earnings surpass a 400 dollar ($400) threshold, you may be required to fill out and submit a W-9 tax form - the exact amount of Revenue Share payment that will trigger a W-9 tax form request will be made by SubscribePlace in its sole discretion, and in conjunction with SubscribePlace’s tax experts. Each individual’s tax liabilities will differ and you are expected to conduct your own due diligence and file tax documentation accordingly based upon income derived from the site. You are responsible for collection of your own sales tax (if applicable). SubscribePlace assumes no responsibility for any individual tax liability based upon your income. SubscribePlace reserves the right to withhold a minimum of 28% of your Revenue Share earnings, or terminate your account if you fail to complete the W-9 tax form or other requests mandated by SubscribePlace. If a Profile Owner changes their address, then the Profile Owner is responsible for emailing <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ae2efe6facaf9ffe8f9e9f8e3e8effae6ebe9efa4e9e5e7">[email&#160;protected]</a> to give us the new correct address for sending out the 1099 tax form.</p>

  <p>When asked via a SubscribePlace popup on a profile account, Profile Owners must submit their SSN and/or EIN information for tax purposes.  Additionally, when asked, Profile Owners must submit their address for tax purposes for the mailing of the 1099 tax form.  If a Profile Owner does not provide the SSN/EIN/Address information, profile earnings may be forfeited, and the profile account may be locked and/or deleted.</p>

  <p>Profile Owners must secure their account information, email, and password.  If another person accesses a Profile Owner account and changes the payout information, SubscribePlace is not responsible for this breach of security and is not liable if the payment on record is switched to another party.  Profile Owners are responsible for their own account security, and any financial loss due to a security breach of the account will be the full responsibility of the Profile Owner.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 60px;"><strong>i. Chargebacks and Disputes</strong></p>

  <p>A transaction can result in a chargeback due to dispute, suspicion of fraud, or other purposes. SubscribePlace reserves the right to withdraw from your unpaid Revenue Share earnings in the event of any dispute, refund, and/or chargeback. You assent and agree that SubscribePlace has full authorization to withdraw, in part or in full, the amount of a refund, dispute or chargeback, along with any associated fees or penalties incurred. SubscribePlace may use the withdrawal amount at its discretion to ensure SubscribePlace does not suffer any financial loss related to the dispute, suspicion of fraud, or other purposes. If your account is pending resolution of any chargebacks, SubscribePlace reserves the right to suspend payment on your account until the subsequent pay period or until such dispute is resolved.</p>

  <p>In its sole discretion, SubscribePlace may lock, delete, terminate or disable access to your account if your account is the subject of three (3) or more credit card chargebacks/disputes in any ninety (90) day period. In its sole discretion, SubscribePlace may lock, delete, terminate, or disable access to your account if you have less than 30 active subscribers and have been the subject of one or more credit card chargeback/disputes. Upon termination, any unpaid Revenue Share earnings in your account are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>Should your account be the subject of an excessive number of credit card chargebacks/disputes, SubscribePlace reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to issue a Dispute Fee(s) for excessive credit card chargebacks/disputes of up to $30.00 per each individual credit card chargeback/dispute - the amount of the Dispute Fee(s) will be at the sole discretion of SubscribePlace, but it shall never exceed $30.00 per each individual credit card chargeback/dispute. For clarity regarding the Dispute Fee for excessive chargebacks/disputes, SubscribePlace considers the term “excessive” to be more than 3 chargebacks/disputes in any 30-day period, and/or 6 chargebacks/disputes in any 90-day period. The Dispute Fee(s) will be in addition to any bank charges that also apply for credit card chargebacks/disputes. Dispute Fees and bank charges are not subject to audit. In agreeing to these Terms you affirm and agree that have read and understood the foregoing.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 60px;"><strong>ii.  Payment Procedure for Revenue Share Earnings and Tips</strong></p>

  <p>If you, as a Profile Owner, qualify for a payment as established by these Terms, you will receive an email from SubscribePlace summarizing your Revenue Share and Tip Earnings (if any). Only Profile Owners who meet the $200 Minimum and are due a payment as per these Terms will receive a SubscribePlace Payout Email. The SubscribePlace Payout Email will be sent to the email account on file on the profile owner’s account. The SubscribePlace Payout Email will be sent within 2-3 business days after the last day of the preceding calendar month. The Payout Email will summarize the preceding month’s Revenue Share, Tip Earnings (if any), and the total payment due the Profile Owner. The SubscribePlace Payout Email will also summarize the total amount of money that is deducted for credit card disputes and/or chargebacks as well as the corresponding bank charges and dispute fees - the deduction amount will be listed as one total deduction amount, and this deduction amount is not subject to itemization and/or audit. Profile owners should allow up to seven (7) business days after receiving their SubscribePlace Payout Email for their money to clear their banking institution and to show up on their banking statement.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;"><strong>e. Minimum Revenue Share Earnings and Termination</strong></p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 60px;"><strong>i. Required $200 Minimum Threshold, Revenue Share Earnings</strong></p>

  <p>If you do not surpass the $200 Minimum threshold in Revenue Share earnings from Active Subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month (as described and defined in these Terms), SubscribePlace reserves the right to terminate your account in its sole discretion. Any unpaid Revenue Share earnings associated with your terminated account are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 0 0 60px;"><strong>ii. Termination of Contributing Profile Owners</strong></p>

  <p>SubscribePlace reserves the right to cancel, lock, terminate, and/or delete your contributing profile account at any time, without notice, if we believe they have violated these Terms for any reason whatsoever. If you are terminated for actual or suspected violation of these Terms, you will not be entitled to a refund. While SubscribePlace may inform you of the reason for cancellation, locking, terminating, and/or deleting your profile, it is under no obligation to inform. Any Revenue Share earnings for the calendar month in which termination of your account is effective are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If your profile owner account has 5 or more Active Subscriptions, but you have not posted any new Content within 24 hours after receiving your 5th paying subscriber, then SubscribePlace reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel, lock, terminate and/or delete your account. Any Revenue Share earnings for the calendar month in which termination of your account is effective are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If your account has 10 days of inactivity and/or no new Content has been posted, then SubscribePlace reserves the right in its sole discretion to lock and/or delete the account and any Revenue Share earnings for the calendar month in which termination of your account is effective are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>As an exception to the foregoing, users who maintain owner accounts are able to place their accounts on away mode. Away mode is a voluntary option, and all subscribers to the account will be notified. Billing will also be suspended while an account is on away mode. If a profile owner goes on away mode, and the profile owner does not return by the last day of the calendar month, then no payment is due for that calendar month.  If a profile owner is not due a payment because they are in away mode, the profile owner will not receive a payment for any potential tips during a month in which they were in ‘away mode’.  If a profile owner does return before the last day of the calendar month, then the profile owner shall receive a percentage of their active subscribe payout based on the percentage of time they were active on the Site (and not in away mode).  For example, if a profile owner has 100 active subscribers at $8 per subscriber, and the profile owner was on away mode for 15 out of the 30 days in the calendar month, then the profile owner was present on the Site for 50% of the calendar month, so the formula for payment will be 50% of the active subscriber number on the final day of the calendar month.  In this example, on the final day of the calendar month, the profile owner had 100 active subscribers, and the profile owner was present for 50% of the calendar month, then the profile owner is due 50% of 100 active subscribers X $8 per subscriber = $400.00.  If the profile owner was present for 50% or more in the calendar month, the profile owner will also be entitled to receive their tips (if any) for the month. If according to this ‘away mode’ calculation, a Profile Owner has earned less than the $200 minimum, then the Profile Owner will not qualify for a payout. As is stated in Section VI (a), there are no rollover earnings from month to month under any circumstance. So, if a Profile Owner shall fall below the $200 minimum due to ‘away mode’ time as per the calculation above, then payouts will not rollover to the next month, in this situation the Profile Owner would have failed to earn the $200 minimum and all rules that apply to the $200 minimum would apply in this case.</p>

  <p>If you create an account that fails to surpass the $200 Minimum threshold in a calendar month (as described and defined in these Terms), SubscribePlace reserves the right in its sole discretion to block or disable access to the account. Any Revenue Share earnings for the calendar month in which termination of your account is effective are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>SubscribePlace will not make a payout to a profile account owner unless that profile owner has completed at least 30 days in good standing, and the account must surpass the $200 Minimum threshold in sales from Active Subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month for a payout to occur. SubscribePlace reserves the right in its sole discretion to make a payout (if any) to a profile owner before the 30-day good standing period has ended.</p>

  <p>While SubscribePlace may inform you of the reason for cancellation, locking, and/or deleting your profile, it is under no obligation to inform.</p>

  <p>Upon request, you are required to provide a state driver’s license and/or passport to the site. If asked by SubscribePlace for this identification which may be requested for any reason, you must provide the requested verification within 72 hours. If verification is not provided within 72 hours, your account may be locked and/or deleted and any Revenue Share earnings for the calendar month in which termination of your account is effective are payable to SubscribePlace and collected as a Hosting Fee associated with SubscribePlace’s overhead related to the hosting of your account and content, and payment processor fees, among others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SubscribePlace reserves the right to refund any unpaid Revenue Share earnings to you in its sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If your account has been locked, deleted, or terminated by SubscribePlace, you are prohibited from creating or establishing a new account in any capacity on the site. You are similarly barred from utilizing any other name, moniker, or mark to establish a new account on the site. If SubscribePlace discovers account creation contrary to this clause and these Terms, it may immediately terminate said account without any prior notice. SubscribePlace may, in its sole discretion, prosecute any violations of this clause to the fullest extent of the law. When deleting a Profile Owner account, SubscribePlace shall remove all content on the profile account within 30 days, and/or the content may be removed much sooner than 30 days - this shall be at SubscribePlace’s discretion. SubscribePlace shall have up to 30 days to remove all content from the profile.</p>

  <p>SubscribePlace does not store credit card information for the purpose of such information to be copied and/or transferred.  The credit card information is stored as tokens in association with 3rd party processing companies (as per PCI compliance).  Accordingly, SubscribePlace will not provide a list of credit cards to profile owners.  Any request for credit card information will be denied.  Any request to transfer credit card data will be denied.</p>

  <p>In the event that a credit card processing company, merchant bank, processing gateway, and/or any 3rd party involved in the collecting and distribution of funds is switched by SubscribePlace, and/or if any of these 3rd party bank/processing entities shall decide to terminate their relationship with SubscribePlace, then accordingly, SubscribePlace is not liable for any loss of business and/or payments due to the switch and/or loss of service.  In the event that no card processing or bank processing is available, then SubscribePlace is not responsible for the loss of business and/or payments in the calendar month that such loss of processing ability happens.  The preceding calendar month payment will be the last payment due the Profile Owner, and then the relationship with the Profile Owner will end with no more payments due for any loss of business in the calendar month that the processing loss occurred, and no more payments will be due for any future months.  Once again, for clarity purposes, the preceding calendar month payment will be the last payment due the Profile Owner.</p>

  <p>A profile owner must complete a full calendar month in order to be paid for that calendar month.  When a profile owner does any of the following: 1) deletes their profile; 2) puts in a delete request to delete their profile; 3) deletes all the content of a profile, and/or 4) publicly declaring that the profile owner is leaving SubscribePlace – then any of the 4 such actions shall be evidence that the profile owner has not completed the current calendar month in which any of these actions have occurred.  If SubscribePlace, in its sole discretion, decides to pay a Profile Owner for a partial month or for the month in which they are intending to delete their profile, SubscribePlace may hold any payments from 31 previous days for up to 120 days to cover any credit card disputes, refunds, and/or liabilities of the Profile Owner.</p>

  <p>In the event of SuscribePlace being sold, in part or in whole, then all profiles, subscribers, and all business from SubscribePlace can be transferred to the purchasing Party.</p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 20px;"><strong>XIII. CLAIMS AND LEGAL ACTIONS</strong></p>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 15px; display: block; margin-bottom: 15px;">

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>a. <u>INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS</u></strong></p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 60px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>i. <u>Agreement to Arbitrate Claims</u></strong></p>

    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>You and SubscribePlace agree that, except for disputes that qualify for small claims, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to these Terms, any aspect of the relationship between us, your use of the site, or any provision of services by SubscribePlace, regardless of the date of accrual of such dispute, shall be resolved in its entirety by individual (not class-wide nor collective) binding arbitration (the “Agreement”). This Agreement to arbitrate applies regardless of whether such claims are based in law or equity, in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.</strong></p>

    <p>This section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside prohibit the application some or all of the provisions of this section, such provisions will not apply to you.</p>

    <p>An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than an action in court, provides for more limited discovery, and is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing. An arbitrator can only award the same damages and relief that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in these Terms.</p>

    <p>You and SubscribePlace agree that their sole relationship is a contractual one governed by the Terms. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to these Terms, the site, or any provision of services by SubscribePlace shall be resolved solely based on the agreements set forth in these Terms.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">a. AAA Arbitration</p>

    <p>Any arbitration between you and SubscribePlace shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the “Rules”). Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Rules, including instructions for how to initiate arbitration, are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of the case on the basis of the applicable law, not equity. If you initiate arbitration, you must serve SubscribePlace’s registered agent for service of process, United States Corporation Agents, Inc., which has locations in every state.</p>

    <p>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class, mass, consolidated or combined actions or arbitrations or proceeding as a private attorney general are not permitted. You and SubscribePlace are each waiving the right to trial by jury. You and SubscribePlace are further giving up the ability to participate in a class, mass, consolidated or combined action or arbitration.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">b. Location of Arbitration/Arbitrator/Cost of Arbitration/Governing Law/Survival</p>

    <p>Any Arbitration between you and SubscribePlace shall take place in the county where you reside and will be determined by a single arbitrator.</p>

    <p>If you are required to pay a filing fee or any other administrative fee by the AAA Rules, such fee shall be paid by you to the extent such fee does not exceed the amount of the fee required to commence a similar action in a court that otherwise would have jurisdiction. For all non-frivolous and proper complaints (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), SubscribePlace will pay the amount of such fee in excess of that amount. The arbitrator will allocate the administrative costs and arbitral fees consistent with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. Reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses will be allocated or awarded only to the extent such allocation or award is available under applicable law.</p>

    <p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, or enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of the Terms.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">c. Statutes of Limitations</p>

    <p>No demand for arbitration may be made after the date when the institution or legal proceedings based on such claim or dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">d. Arbitration Procedure</p>

    <p>Unless you and SubscribePlace agree otherwise, for all disputes concerning an amount less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), the parties shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents. The arbitrator will not hold a hearing unless, upon request of a party, the arbitrator in its discretion decides a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. For claims over $15,000.00, SubscribePlace shall pay your filing fee under the AAA Rules, provided that you agree that both parties shall submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing and that the arbitrator shall make an award based only on the documents, without a hearing being held. Notwithstanding this provision, the parties may agree to proceed with arbitration without a hearing at any time. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">e. Exceptions - Access to Small Claims Courts, Injunctions, Intellectual Property</p>

    <p>All parties shall retain the right to seek adjudication and bring an individual action in small claims court, for individual disputes within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>All parties retain the right to adjudicate in any court of competent jurisdiction, disputes related to claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents), including such claims seeking injunctive relief.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">f. Award</p>

    <p>The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; such award or judgment cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, unless a brief explanation of the reasons is requested by one of the parties, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, unless you and SubscribePlace agree otherwise, and the arbitrator may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.</p>

    <p>If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses, to the extent permitted under applicable law. SubscribePlace will not seek, and hereby waives all rights SubscribePlace may have under applicable law to recover attorney’s fees and expenses if SubscribePlace prevails in arbitration.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">g. Confidentiality of Arbitration</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, you and SubscribePlace agree that the filing of arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, any documents exchanged or produced during the arbitration proceeding, any briefs or other documents prepared for the arbitration, and the arbitral award shall all be kept fully and completely confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other party, except to the extent necessary to enforce this arbitration provision, arbitral award or other rights of the parties, or as required by law or court order. This confidentiality provision does not foreclose the American Arbitration Association from reporting certain consumer arbitration case information as required by state law.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">h. Acknowledgements</p>

    <p>You and SubscribePlace acknowledge and agree that pursuant to these Terms:</p>

    <ol start="2" style="padding-left: 60px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li>YOU AND SUBSCRIBEPLACE AGREE THAT WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, SubscribePlace, OR ANY RELATED THIRD PARTIES;</li>
  <li>YOU AND SUBSCRIBEPLACE AGREE THAT WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT, OTHER THAN A STATE SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS DEFINED ABOVE, RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST YOU, SubscribePlace, OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES;</li>
  <li>YOU AND SUBSCRIBEPLACE AGREE THAT WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT REVIEW ANY DECISION OR AWARD OF AN ARBITRATOR, WHETHER INTERIM OR FINAL, EXCEPT FOR APPEALS BASED ON THOSE GROUNDS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 10 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT;</li>
  <li>YOU AND SUBSCRIBEPLACE AGREE THAT WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER CAPACITY, JOIN AS A CLASS MEMBER, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY CLASS, MASS, CONSOLIDATED OR COMBINED ACTION OR ARBITRATION FILED AGAINST YOU, SubscribePlace, AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.</li>
</ol>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">i. Demand of Arbitration - Notification</p>

    <p>You and SubscribePlace agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before demanding and initiating arbitration. If either you or SubscribePlace intends to seek arbitration, the party seeking arbitration must first send the other party a written notice that describes the nature and the basis of the claim or dispute, as well as setting forth the relief sought. If you and SubscribePlace do not agree to resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or SubscribePlace may proceed with arbitration. Written notice to SubscribePlace must be given by first class mail or pre-paid post to SubscribePlace 92 Cornerstone Dr. #322, Cary, NC 27519. SubscribePlace may give notice by means of electronic mail to your email address listed in your account, or by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to your address in your account. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after mailing or posting (if sent by first class mail or pre-paid post) or 12 hours after sending (if sent by email). Any claim or dispute shall be extinguished unless you or SubscribePlace complies with this “Demand of Arbitration – Notification” clause.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">j. Changes</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding any of the modification-related provisions contained in these Terms, if SubscribePlace changes this “Claims and Legal Actions” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing SubscribePlace with written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: SubscribePlace 92 Cornerstone Dr. #322, Cary, NC 27519, or to email from the address associated with your account to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fb939e978bbb888e9988988992999e8b979a989ed5989496">[email&#160;protected]</a> within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Update” date below. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this “Claims and Legal Actions” section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and SubscribePlace in accordance with the provisions of this “Claims and Legal Actions” section as of the date your first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms). Alternatively, if you have not previously accepted Terms containing an arbitration provision, your rejection (within 30 days such Terms became effective as described above) of this “Claims and Legal Actions” section will not bind you to this arbitration Agreement.</p>

    <p>Any changes that are made to the Terms of this “Claims and Legal Actions” section will not apply retroactively, and will not apply to any dispute of which both parties had actual notice on or prior to the date of the change or amendment.</p>

    <p style="padding: 0 0 0 40px;">k. Severability</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or ineffective for any reason, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this arbitration provision, and the arbitrator shall have the authority to amend any provisions deemed invalid or ineffective to make the same valid and enforceable.</p>

To the extent Digital Goods sold pursuant to these Terms are deemed to be “goods,” as defined in California Commercial Code §2105, California Commercial Code §2401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) such definitions will apply to the transfer of ownership of goods between the buyer and the seller and/or Content provider and subscriber, unless the buyer and the seller or Content provider and subscriber agree otherwise.

  <p>SubscribePlace may amend these Terms at any time. The right to amend these Terms includes the right to modify, add to, or remove clauses in these Terms. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, all amended terms shall be effective immediately after they are posted.
